== Football and the Blues
I am a huge fan of football. My favourite club is [https://www.chelseafc.com/ Chelsea FC]. I have been supporting the club since my childhood. I go wild watching thrilling matches of Chelsea. My favourite footballer is Eden Hazard (top player from Premier league in FIFA-18 rankings). Join my excitement and [https://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/ support Chelsea]. Go blues for the Champions League.

A wonderful away win at Ajax for Chelsea. It was a hard fought match for both teams with chelsea scoring the late goal from Mitchy Batshuayi. With Valencia losing to Lille, we gain the slightest advantage in out champions league group. Next up Burnley away in premier league. Go Blues!

== Books, Books and more books
I read a lot of books and novels. I own a Kindle and like reading novels in it before going to bed. If I find a novel interesting, I don't sleep until I complete the whole book. My favourite genres are Fantasy and Historical Fiction. Some of my favourite authors are [http://rickriordan.com/ Rick Riordan], [http://danbrown.com/ Dan Brown], [http://www.eoincolfer.com/ Eoin Colfer], [http://www.jonathanstroud.com/ Jonathan Stroud], [http://www.alagaesia.com/ Christopher Paolini], [https://brandonsanderson.com/ Brandon Sanderson], [https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4785.Alexandre_Dumas Alexandre Dumas], [http://www.agathachristie.com/ Agatha Christie] and last but not the least [http://www.arthurconandoyle.com/ Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]. (I started my reading career with Sherlock Holmes). I am always looking for new books to read and welcome any new suggestions.

== Gaming woes
I am a gamer in my free time. I like strategy and multi-player games like Age of Empires - 2, Dota 2, Clash Royale, FIFA (14-17), Assasin's Creed, Call of Duty etc. My friends always tease me on my horrific response time and map awareness in the game. I am famous for knowing all the in-game mechanics and strategies of the game but panicking in the game. I am also famous for my supporting skills in Dota 2 (Now don't go about asking my MMR). Kudos to Steam for making gaming more affordable.
