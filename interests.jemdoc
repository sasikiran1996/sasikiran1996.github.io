== Football and the Blues
I am a huge fan of football. My favourite club is [https://www.chelseafc.com/ Chelsea FC]. I have been supporting the club since my childhood. I go wild watching thrilling matches of Chelsea. My favourite footballer is Eden Hazard (top player from Premier league in FIFA-18 rankings). Join my excitement and [https://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/ support Chelsea]. Go blues for the Champions League.

What a great way to end the 2019 season! Third in the premier league and winners of the europa league (thus denying arsenal a champions league spot LOL). Though this win has been followed by the deaprture of Eden Hazard and Sarri, we are still strong as a team. We are now building a team with more emphasis on youth for the next season with the appointment of Super Frank as the coach. Looking forward to next season.. Go Blues!

== Books, Books and more books
I read a lot of books and novels. I own a Kindle and like reading novels in it before going to bed. If I find a novel interesting, I don't sleep until I complete the whole book. My favourite genres are Fantasy and Historical Fiction. Some of my favourite authors are [http://rickriordan.com/ Rick Riordan], [http://danbrown.com/ Dan Brown], [http://www.eoincolfer.com/ Eoin Colfer], [http://www.jonathanstroud.com/ Jonathan Stroud], [http://www.alagaesia.com/ Christopher Paolini], [https://brandonsanderson.com/ Brandon Sanderson], [https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4785.Alexandre_Dumas Alexandre Dumas], [http://www.agathachristie.com/ Agatha Christie] and last but not the least [http://www.arthurconandoyle.com/ Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]. (I started my reading career with Sherlock Holmes). I am always looking for new books to read and welcome any new suggestions.

== Gaming woes
I am a gamer in my free time. I like strategy and multi-player games like Age of Empires - 2, Dota 2, Clash Royale, FIFA (14-17), Assasin's Creed, Call of Duty etc. My friends always tease me on my horrific response time and map awareness in the game. I am famous for knowing all the in-game mechanics and strategies of the game but panicking in the game. I am also famous for my supporting skills in Dota 2 (Now don't go about asking my MMR). Kudos to Steam for making gaming more affordable.
