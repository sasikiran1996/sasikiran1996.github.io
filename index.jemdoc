Hey there. I am a first year student at [https://www.cics.umass.edu/ University of Massachusetts Amherst] pursuing a Masters degree in Computer Science and Engineering. My interests are in Deep Learning and its application in solving Computer Vision problems and Reinforcement Learning. I am very excited about the new upcoming developments in vision like self-driving cars, Augmented Reality and application of Reinforcement Learning to solve multiplayer games.
